  Some text here for summary - without a blog, your SEO can tank, you'll have nothing to promote on social media, you'll have no clout with your leads and customers, and you'll have fewer pages to put those valuable calls-to-action that generate inbound leads.

## Plain Text

You've probably heard how paramount blogging is to the success of your marketing. But it's important that you learn how to start a blog and write blog posts for it so that each article supports your business.

Without a blog, your SEO can tank, you'll have nothing to promote on social media, you'll have no clout with your leads and customers, and you'll have fewer pages to put those valuable calls-to-action that generate inbound leads.

### Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

### Table

| # | Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
| - | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Val1 | Val2 | Val3 |
| 2 | Value1 | Value2 | Value3 |

### Quotes

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

### Link (anchor)

[This text](https://naver.com) leads you to Naver.

### Code

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
// Javascript code without syntax highlight
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
// Javascript code with syntax highlight
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

```scala
// Scala code : Sample
package examples.actors

import scala.actors._
import scala.actors.Actor._

object Message {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val n = try {
      Integer.parseInt(args(0))
    }
    catch {
      case _ =>
        println("Usage: examples.actors.Message <n>")
        Predef.exit
    }
    val nActors = 500
    val finalSum = n * nActors
    Scheduler.impl = new SingleThreadedScheduler

    def beh(next: Actor, sum: Int) {
      react {
        case value: Int =>
          val j = value + 1; val nsum = sum + j
          if (next == null && nsum >= finalSum) {
            println(nsum)
            System.exit(0)
          }
          else {
            if (next != null) next ! j
            beh(next, nsum)
          }
      }
    }

    def actorChain(i: Int, a: Actor): Actor =
      if (i > 0) actorChain(i-1, actor(beh(a, 0))) else a

    val firstActor = actorChain(nActors, null)
    var i = n; while (i > 0) { firstActor ! 0; i -= 1 }
  }
}
```

## Equation (MathJAX)

<!-- http://atomurl.net/math/ -->

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

When $(a \ne 0)$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

$$x = \lim_{a \rightarrow b}$$

This formula $f(x) = x^2$ is an example.

$$ x = a_0 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_1 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_2 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_3 + a_4}}}$$

$x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$, ..., $x_i$

## Diagram (MermaidJS)

### Sample: Sequence

<div class="mermaid">
sequenceDiagram
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
John-->>Alice: Great!
John->>Bob: How about you?
Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
</div>

### Sample: Pie Chart

<div class="mermaid">
pie
"Dogs" : 386
"Cats" : 85
"Rats" : 15
</div>

### Daniel's sample1

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;

Spark -->|Aggregate| Redis
end
</div>

### Daniel's sample2

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
subgraph Aggregation Tree
Ag1{{Aggregation 1}} --> Op1[/Operation 1/]
subgraph Operation Subtree
Op1 --> Op2[/Operation 2/]
Op2 --> Opd1(Operand 1)

Op1 --> Opd3(Operand 3)
end
Ag1 --- Ag2{{Aggregation 2}}
Ag2 --> OpSub1[/Operation Subtree 2\]
Ag2 --- Ag3{{Aggregation 3}}
Ag3 --> OpSub2[/Operation Subtree 3\]
Ag3 --> None((None))
end

Maybe because, unless you're one of the few people who actually like writing, business blogging kind of stinks. You have to find words, string them together into sentences ... ugh, where do you even start?
